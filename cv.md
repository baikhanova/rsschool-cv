### About me
> In the past for 4+ years I taught programming languages, game creation and design. Therefore, I have basic knowledge of just a little bit. But I don't really want that. I want to focus on the front-end development and move in this direction.

> At the moment I am actively studying front-end development. As a specialist, it is very interesting for me to know not only in the form of theory, but also to use knowledge in practice, so to speak, in battle.

> If we talk about the future. I plan to study in depth React, Vue and TypeScript.

### Skills
- design (AI, PS, Figma, Canva)
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript, ES6+, basic TypeScript
- basic React
- SPA Apps
- VCS (Git)
- CMS sys. (WordPress, Wix)
- programming (C#, C++, Python, JS, TS)
- developing 2D, 3D and AR games on the Unity platform.

### Code review
```
function squareSum(numbers){
  let sum = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += Math.pow(numbers[i], 2);
  }
  return sum;
}

function evenOrOdd(number) {
  if (number % 2 == 0) {
    return "Even";
  }
  else {
    return "Odd";
  }
}

function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  let countOfSheeps = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arrayOfSheep.length; i++) {
    if (arrayOfSheep[i] == true) {
      countOfSheeps += 1;
    }
  }
  return countOfSheeps;
}

function noSpace(x){
  let str = x.replace(/\s+/g, '')
  //g-global s-spaces
  return str;
}
```
